我看到了我的爱恋
我飞到她的身边
> I saw my love, I flew to her side, spiritual forms, trending on Artstation


我捧出给她的礼物
那是一小块凝固的时间
时间上有美丽的条纹
摸起来像浅海的泥一样柔软
> a surreal soap floating in cosmic whirl
That's a small piece of solidified time
beautiful streaks
Soft to the touch

她把时间涂满全身

然后拉起我飞向存在的边缘
> There are beautiful streaks in time, It feels as soft as the mud of the shallow sea, Pulls me to the edge of existence, trending on Artstation


这是灵态的飞行
我们眼中的星星像幽灵
星星眼中的我们也像幽灵
> This is the flight of spiritual forms
The stars in our eyes are like phantoms
We are also like phantoms in the eyes of the stars
